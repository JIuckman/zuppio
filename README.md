<p>Welcome to <b>Zuppio</b> support central! <b>Zuppio</b> is a Salesforce devops tool with a caveat: everything it can do on one org can be done on hundreds of orgs in one iteration.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Zuppio</b> works with managed packagesâ€™ metadata simplifying the upgrade flow of a managed package - upgrade package versions, update subscriber-editable metadata and more, en masse;</li>
    <li>Connect <b>Zuppio</b> to your github or bitbucket and make it a part of your CI/CD pipeline: set up webhooks and trigger deploys on commit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can log a case and our team will take care of it. For any other questions donâ€™t hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:const@zupp.io">const@zupp.io</a> or via contact form on our website!</p>
